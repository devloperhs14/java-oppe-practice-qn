## Q1
Write a class named **Calculator** that has the following methods:
* `sum(double a, double b)` that prints the value of a + b
* `subtraction(double a, double b)` that prints the value of a - b
* `multiply(double a, double b) `that prints the value of a * b
* `division(double a, double b)` that prints the value of a / b
