# Java Programming Task

## Problem Statement

Write a Java program that, given as input the name, price, and stock quantity of some products, prints the filtered stream of products that have a price greater than 5000.00 and a stock quantity of more than 10.

### Requirements

* **Class `Product`** should have the following members:
  * **Private instance variables:**
    * `String name`
    * `double price`
    * `int stockQuantity`
  * **A constructor** to initialize instance variables.
  * **Method `toString`** to print in the format shown in the test cases.
  * **Accessor methods** for `price` and `stockQuantity`.
  * **Method `productProcessor`** that:
    * Takes an `ArrayList` of `Product` objects as input.
    * Returns a filtered stream of premium products with sufficient stock.
    * **Filtering Criteria:**
      * Price of the product is greater than `5000.00`.
      * Stock quantity of the product is greater than `10`.

* **Class `StreamTest`** should have the following members:
  * **Method `main`** that:
    * Creates an `ArrayList` of `Product` objects by taking input in the order: `name, price, stockQuantity`.
    * Invokes the `productProcessor` method to filter premium products with sufficient stock.
    * Displays the filtered products.

### Task

* Define the method `productProcessor` in class `Product`.
* Enclose everything in triple backticks (` ``` `) when writing the Java code.
